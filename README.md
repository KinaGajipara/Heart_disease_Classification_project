Developed predictive models for heart disease classification using machine learning techniques (Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN) to identify high-risk patients based on medical indicators such as age, cholesterol, and chest pain. Applied data preprocessing and transformation to enhance model accuracy, with the Neural Network model achieving the highest recall in predicting disease severity levels, enabling targeted intervention strategies for patient care.
