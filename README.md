# Heart_disease_Classification_project

Heart Disease Project (Classification Problem)
•	The project aims to build predictive models for heart disease classification using machine learning and neural network techniques, with various medical predictors like age, cholesterol, chest pain, and more.
•	Developed and evaluated machine learning models, including neural networks, decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and KNN, to predict heart attack likelihood using R. Applied data wrangling and manipulation techniques to preprocess and transform the dataset.
•	The Neural Network model outperformed others, achieving the highest accuracy, precision, and F1 score. It was the most promising model for predicting heart disease based on medical characteristics, while Decision Tree and Random Forest showed moderate results.
